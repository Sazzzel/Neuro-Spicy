## <u>Neuro-Spicy</u>

[View live project here]()

This proposed website aims to bridge that gap in understanding. By providing relatable scenarios and clear explanations, the platform will help users empathize with and better navigate relationships with people who have ADHD. The website's primary goal is to facilitate better communication and reduce the frustration, confusion, and tension that can result from the common symptoms of ADHD.

## User Experience (UX)  

### **User Stories**

### Primary Goal

The website will be designed as an educational resource, offering insights into why certain behaviors and reactions occur in individuals with ADHD. Its core purpose is to:

    *  Foster empathy and understanding: By breaking down ADHD symptoms into understandable and relatable cenarios, the website will help users grasp why a seemingly small incident 
       might trigger a strong reaction.

    *  Reduce conflict: When people better understand the underlying reasons behind ADHD-driven behaviors, they can approach conversations and conflicts with more patience and less 
       frustration, leading to healthier, more constructive dialogues.

    *  Provide tools for communication: In addition to understanding, the website will offer practical advice and tools for better communication with people who have ADHD, helping to 
       navigate difficult moments more effectively.


### **First Time Users**

   * New users will find a friendly and easy to use website.
   * New users can asscess all pages and information from the navigation section found at the top of the page.
   * New users will find a button on all pages of websites that can help. (minds matter, Heaven Talking Therapies)

### **Returning Users** 

   * Returning users can easily find and re-read the information for help.
   * Returning users can easily find ways to share the information to friends or family member.

After getting feedback from people who live with ADHD. I deciceded to change my website to better cater to the needs of the people who it is aimed towards.

As you can see from the two wireframes there is a drastic change. This is due to the site being to busy and distracting. Taking the people it is targeted towards away from the imformation.

I have left the old wireframes in to show the differences.

### **5. Surface**  

I designed a creation process from a non- ADHD point of view. A view from someone who lives with people that have ADHD and wishing there was a website like this to help me understand this condition.

* I picked a palette that is welcoming, calming and most importantly visually apealing to people with ADHD.
* I picked a clear and easy to read font for my headings and titles.
* I picked a clear and easy to read font for my paragrahs.

## Design  

### **Color Scheme**

The Original colours didn't work for the site. These are the new colours I have used.

I changed these due to the way the original colours clashed and feedback from testers.

I chose these fonts as they are easy to read.
The reasearch i did have been suggested that these fonts are easy to read for people with ADHD. 

* For headers and footers
   * [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono?query=+Fira+Sans) was used to inport Fira Mono bold with a weight of 700

* For the rest of the site.
   * [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend?query=lex) was used to import the font Lexend with a weight of 300/400

### **Imagery** 

The images I have chosen are to make the site feel safe and welcoming. I have also chosen a few in hope that it can make someone smile while learning how to better their realtionship with Neuro-Spicy people.
