[View live project here]()

This proposed website aims to bridge that gap in understanding. By providing relatable scenarios and clear explanations, the platform will help users empathize with and better navigate relationships with people who have ADHD. The website's primary goal is to facilitate better communication and reduce the frustration, confusion, and tension that can result from the common symptoms of ADHD.

## User Experience (UX)  

### **User Stories**

### Primary Goal

The website will be designed as an educational resource, offering insights into why certain behaviors and reactions occur in individuals with ADHD. Its core purpose is to:

    *  Foster empathy and understanding: By breaking down ADHD symptoms into understandable and relatable scenarios, the website will help users grasp why a seemingly small incident 
       might trigger a strong reaction.

    *  Reduce conflict: When people better understand the underlying reasons behind ADHD-driven behaviors, they can approach conversations and conflicts with more patience and less 
       frustration, leading to healthier, more constructive dialogues.

    *  Provide tools for communication: In addition to understanding, the website will offer practical advice and tools for better communication with people who have ADHD, helping to 
       navigate difficult moments more effectively.


### **First Time Users**

   * New users will find a friendly and easy to use website.
   * New users can asscess all pages and information from the navigation section found at the top of the page.
   * New users will find a button on all pages of websites that can help. (minds matter, Heaven Talking Therapies)

# Creation Process  
  
### **1. Strategy** 


I want to create a website that helps individuals understand the behaviors and reactions of those with ADHD is a meaningful and necessary project. It will fill a critical gap by offering:

relatable, real-world scenarios and clear explanations, which could help reduce the conflicts in relationships and fostering deeper empathy. 

By helping people understand that many of these behaviors stem from ADHD symptoms rather than personality flaws.

The website will promote healthier, more understanding relationships for those living with ADHD and the people who care about them.
